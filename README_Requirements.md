# Fullstack JS dev test

## Goal
Create a simple app to list expedients and substitutes.

Use any git service (github, bitbucket...) to store the repository and share the link via email.


### Backend:
-   Use nodejs and express.
-   Store DB.json file in your project and use it as a DB output.
-   4 routes: all expedients, single expedient by id, all substitutes and single substitute by id


### Frontend:
-   Make it with react (can be started using create-react-app or any other boilerplate).
-   Use react-router.
-   Pages: substitute list, substitute page, expedient list, expedient page.


### Bonus track (just if you're enjoing and more fun is needed):
-   Create new expedient (as we don't have DB you need to use FS nodejs module to edit the json file)
-   Use hooks in react
-   Login (you can use libraries like passport or external tools like Auth0)
-   Extend info in DB json.
-   ...
